# Hostnames

I've had this local list of nouns floating around for a while. Originally I was using it for hostnames in certain homelab networks.

#### Some ideas:

Geographical (countries, cities, parks, rivers, lakes, streets),
entertainment (flintsones, simpsons, disney films, celebrities),
companies (hotels, airports, local shops, restarants),
astronomy (planets, comets, space missions),
literature (mythology, philosophers, writers of particular generes, languages),
political (presidents, judges, congressmen, terminology),
science (units of measure, anatomy, instruments, scientists),
industry (tools, machines, inventions, inventors),
computers (terminology, programming languages, number systems)
